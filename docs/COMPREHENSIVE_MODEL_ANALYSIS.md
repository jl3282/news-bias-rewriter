🏷️ Sources: Multiple news outlets
📁 Pre-split: train/validation/test ready
```

**Class Distribution (Random Split):**
- **Center**: 12,590 articles (33.5%) ✅ **MUCH BETTER BALANCE**
- **Left**: 10,285 articles (27.4%)
- **Right**: 13,399 articles (35.7%)

**Key Advantages:**
- ✅ **Balanced classes**: Center representation increased from 19.6% → 33.5%

- ✅ **Pre-split data**: Professional train/val/test splits
- ✅ **Rich metadata**: Source, topic, date, authors
- ✅ **Two split strategies**: Random and media-based splits available

### Critical Insight: Class Balance Impact

| Dataset | Center % | Center Articles | Expected Model Performance |
|---------|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| AllSides | 19.6% | 4,253 | Poor center detection (current issue) |
| JSON Dataset | 33.5% | 12,590 | **Significantly improved center detection** |

**⭐ Key Prediction**: Training on the JSON dataset should **dramatically improve center class performance** due to 3x more center examples.

## 🔍 Error Analysis - Current Model

### Error Patterns (AllSides Test Set)

**Overall Performance:**
- ✅ **Correct Predictions**: 59.7% (1,947/3,262 articles)
- ❌ **Prediction Errors**: 40.3% (1,315/3,262 articles)

**Error Breakdown by True Class:**
- **Center → Other**: Highest error rate (~60%) - **PRIMARY ISSUE**
- **Left → Right/Center**: Moderate error rate (~30%)
- **Right → Left/Center**: Moderate error rate (~45%)

**Error Characteristics:**
- **Low confidence errors**: Model often uncertain about center articles
- **Systematic center misclassification**: Center articles frequently predicted as left/right
- **Boundary confusion**: Subtle distinctions between left/center and center/right

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Data Scarcity**: Only 638 center articles in test set vs 1,541 left, 1,083 right
2. **Training Imbalance**: Model saw 70% fewer center examples during training
3. **Label Ambiguity**: Center articles inherently harder to classify (less distinctive language)

## 🚀 Improvement Strategy & Recommendations

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (High Impact)

#### 1. **Dataset Expansion** ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
```bash
# Next Action: Train on JSON dataset (37K articles)
- Expected center F1 improvement: 47% → 65%+ 
- Overall accuracy improvement: 60% → 70%+
- Training time: ~2-3 hours (vs 1.5h current)
```

#### 2. **Class Balancing Techniques**
- **Weighted loss function** to penalize center misclassification more heavily
- **Oversampling** center articles during training
- **Ensemble approach** with center-specialized model

#### 3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
- Learning rate sweep: [1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5]
- Batch size optimization: [8, 16, 32] 
- Epoch tuning: [3, 4, 5] epochs

### Phase 2: Advanced Improvements (Medium Impact)

#### 4. **Multi-Dataset Training**
- Combine AllSides + JSON datasets (58K total articles)
- Cross-dataset validation for robustness
- Temporal diversity (2020 + 2022 data)

#### 5. **Model Architecture Enhancements**
- **roberta-large** (355M params vs current 125M)
- **DeBERTa-v3-large** for potentially better performance
- **Ensemble methods** (multiple models + voting)

#### 6. **Advanced Training Techniques**
- **Back-translation augmentation** for data diversity
- **Focal loss** for hard example focus
- **Gradual unfreezing** for better feature learning

### Phase 3: Specialized Improvements (Lower Impact)

#### 7. **Feature Engineering**
- Source bias incorporation (news outlet known biases)
- Temporal features (article date/context)
- Topic-specific bias patterns

#### 8. **Evaluation Improvements**
- Cross-dataset evaluation (train on one, test on other)
- Media-based splits (evaluate across different news sources)
- Human evaluation studies for ground truth validation
